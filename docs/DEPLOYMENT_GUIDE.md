# Zync - Deployment Guide (Simple Setup)

## What is Deployment?
Deployment means setting up Zync so people can use it. Think of it like opening a new office - you need to set up all the equipment, security, and procedures before people can start working.

## Before You Start

### What You'll Need

**Technical Requirements:**
- A computer or server to run Zync
- Internet connection
- Basic understanding of file management
- Admin access to your computer/server

**Information to Gather:**
- Domain name (like `yourcompany.com`) if you want a custom web address
- Email settings for notifications
- Security certificates (for HTTPS)
- Access to your network/firewall settings

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Simple Desktop Installation (Easiest)

**Best for:** Small teams (1-10 people) on a local network

**Steps:**
1. Download Zync from the official source
2. Run the installer
3. Follow the setup wizard
4. Create your first admin account
5. Start using Zync on your local computer

**Pros:** Quick setup, no technical knowledge needed
**Cons:** Only accessible from one computer

### Option 2: Local Network Installation (Recommended)

**Best for:** Teams in the same office (10-50 people)

**What you'll need:**
- A dedicated computer to act as the server
- Network access for team members
- Basic router configuration

**Steps:**
1. Install Zync on a dedicated computer
2. Configure it to accept connections from other computers
3. Set up user accounts for your team
4. Test access from different computers on your network

### Option 3: Cloud/Internet Installation (Advanced)

**Best for:** Large teams, remote workers, or public access

**What you'll need:**
- A cloud server (like Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure)
- Domain name and SSL certificate
- More technical knowledge or IT support

## Step-by-Step Local Network Setup

### 1. Preparing Your Server Computer

**Choosing the right computer:**
- Use a dedicated computer that will stay on all the time
- Ensure it has enough memory (8GB RAM minimum)
- Make sure it has sufficient storage space (at least 100GB free)
- Stable internet connection

**Setting up the environment:**
1. Install a fresh operating system (Windows 10/11, macOS, or Ubuntu Linux)
2. Update all software to the latest versions
3. Install required software (Node.js, database software)
4. Create a dedicated user account for Zync

### 2. Installing Zync

**Basic installation:**
1. Download the Zync installation package
2. Extract it to a folder like `C:\Zync` (Windows) or `/opt/zync` (Linux/Mac)
3. Open a command prompt or terminal
4. Navigate to the Zync folder
5. Run the installation command: `npm install`
6. Start Zync: `npm start`

**First-time setup:**
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Create your admin account
4. Follow the setup wizard
5. Configure basic settings

### 3. Network Configuration

**Making Zync accessible to others:**

**Find your computer's IP address:**
- Windows: Open Command Prompt, type `ipconfig`
- Mac: System Preferences → Network
- Linux: Type `ip addr show` in terminal

**Configure your router (if needed):**
1. Access your router's admin panel (usually `192.168.1.1`)
2. Set up port forwarding for port 5000
3. Point it to your server computer's IP address

**Test the connection:**
1. From another computer on your network
2. Go to `http://[your-server-ip]:5000`
3. Try logging in with your admin account

### 4. Security Setup

**Basic security measures:**

**Change default passwords:**
- Admin account password
- Database passwords
- Any default system passwords

**Enable HTTPS (recommended):**
1. Get an SSL certificate (free from Let's Encrypt)
2. Install it on your server
3. Configure Zync to use HTTPS
4. Update all URLs to use `https://` instead of `http://`

**Firewall configuration:**
1. Enable firewall on your server computer
2. Only allow necessary ports (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS)
3. Block all other incoming connections
4. Consider setting up a VPN for remote access

### 5. User Account Setup

**Creating user accounts:**
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to Admin Panel → Users
3. Click "Add User"
4. Fill in user details
5. Set appropriate permissions
6. Send login details to users

**Setting up permissions:**
- **Admin:** Full access, can approve requests
- **Power User:** Can perform more actions with fewer approvals
- **Basic User:** Needs approval for most actions (recommended for new users)

## Advanced Configuration

### 6. Database Setup

**For small installations:**
- Zync uses SQLite by default (no setup needed)
- Database file is stored locally
- Automatic backups recommended

**For larger installations:**
- Consider PostgreSQL for better performance
- Set up on separate database server
- Configure connection settings in Zync

### 7. Backup Strategy

**Automatic backups:**
1. Go to Admin Panel → Backup Settings
2. Enable automatic daily backups
3. Choose backup location (preferably on different computer/drive)
4. Test backup and restore process

**What to backup:**
- User accounts and projects
- System configuration
- Database files
- Integration settings
- Security certificates

### 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

**Health monitoring:**
- Check system status daily
- Monitor storage space usage
- Review approval queues regularly
- Watch for error messages

**Regular maintenance:**
- Update Zync software monthly
- Review and rotate passwords quarterly
- Clean up old files and projects
- Review user access permissions

## Domain Name and Public Access

### 9. Setting Up Custom Domain

**If you want `zync.yourcompany.com` instead of an IP address:**

1. **Buy a domain name** (if you don't have one)
2. **Configure DNS settings:**
   - Create an A record pointing to your server's IP address
   - Example: `zync.yourcompany.com → 192.168.1.100`
3. **Update Zync configuration** to use the new domain
4. **Get SSL certificate** for the domain
5. **Test access** using the new domain name

### 10. Public Internet Access

**Making Zync available from anywhere on the internet:**

**Security considerations (VERY IMPORTANT):**
- Use strong passwords for all accounts
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Keep software updated
- Use HTTPS only
- Consider VPN access instead

**Router configuration:**
1. Set up dynamic DNS (if your IP address changes)
2. Configure port forwarding for ports 80 and 443
3. Point to your Zync server
4. Test from outside your network

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 11. Connection Problems

**Users can't access Zync:**
- Check if Zync is running
- Verify IP address and port
- Test from the same computer first
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure router port forwarding is correct

**Slow performance:**
- Check server computer resources (CPU, memory)
- Review network bandwidth
- Look for large files taking up space
- Consider upgrading server hardware

### 12. Security Issues

**Login problems:**
- Verify user accounts are active
- Check password requirements
- Review account lockout settings
- Look for failed login attempts

**Approval system not working:**
- Confirm admin accounts are active
- Check approval service status
- Review logs for error messages
- Restart Zync if necessary

## Scaling and Growth

### 13. Growing Your Installation

**When to upgrade:**
- More than 50 active users
- Running out of storage space
- Performance becoming slow
- Need better security or features

**Upgrade options:**
- Move to a more powerful server
- Set up database on separate computer
- Add load balancing for multiple servers
- Migrate to cloud hosting

### 14. Best Practices for Large Deployments

**Organization:**
- Create user groups and teams
- Set up project templates
- Implement consistent naming conventions
- Regular training for new users

**Security:**
- Regular security audits
- Update procedures
- Incident response plan
