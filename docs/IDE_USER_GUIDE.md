# Zync - User Guide (Easy Steps for Everyone)

## What is Zync?
Zync is a coding environment that runs on your computer. Think of it as a safe place to write, test, and manage your code projects - like having your own private coding studio.

## Getting Started

**Terminal:** A place to type commands
**Documentation:** Help guides (like this one!)

## Working with Projects

## Working with Files

### 6. Creating Files

### 7. Editing Files

**Opening a file:**
- Click on any file in the file explorer
- It will open in the main editor area

**Writing code:**
- Just start typing in the editor
- Zync will automatically color-code your text to help you read it
- Use Ctrl+S (Windows) or Cmd+S (Mac) to save your changes

**Basic editing tips:**
- **Undo:** Ctrl+Z (Cmd+Z on Mac)
- **Copy:** Ctrl+C (Cmd+C on Mac)
- **Paste:** Ctrl+V (Cmd+V on Mac)
- **Find text:** Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac)

### 8. Organizing Files

**Creating folders:**
1. Right-click in the file explorer
2. Choose "New Folder"
3. Name your folder (like "images" or "styles")

**Moving files:**
- Drag and drop files between folders
- Or right-click → Cut, then right-click in destination → Paste

**Deleting files:**

- Choose "Delete"
- **Remember:** This needs admin approval

## Running Your Code

### 9. Testing Your Work

**For web projects (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):**
1. Look for a "Preview" or "Run" button
2. Click it to see your website in a preview window
3. Any changes you make will update automatically

**For other code (Python, Node.js):**
1. Open the terminal (bottom panel)
2. Type the command to run your code:
   - Python: `python filename.py`
   - Node.js: `node filename.js`
3. Press Enter
4. **Remember:** Running code needs admin approval

### 10. Understanding the Terminal

The terminal is like a text-based way to control your computer:

**Basic commands:**
- `ls` (Mac/Linux) or `dir` (Windows): See what files are in the current folder
- `cd foldername`: Move into a folder
- `cd ..`: Go back to the parent folder
- `clear` (Mac/Linux) or `cls` (Windows): Clear the terminal screen

**Running your programs:**
- Python: `python yourfile.py`
- Node.js: `node yourfile.js`
- Opening files: `open filename` (Mac) or `start filename` (Windows)

## Getting Help and Approval

### 11. The Approval System

Zync is designed to be very safe, so many actions need approval:

**What needs approval:**
- Creating or deleting files
- Running code
- Installing new software
- Uploading files from your computer

**How to request approval:**
1. Try to do the action (like create a file)
2. Zync will show an "Approval Required" message
3. Your request goes to an administrator
4. You'll get a notification when they approve or deny it

**Tips for getting approval:**
- Explain what you're trying to do
- Be patient - admins review requests regularly
- Ask for help if you're unsure about something

### 12. Getting Help

**If you're stuck:**
1. Check this user guide first
2. Look at the documentation section
3. Ask your administrator for help
4. Try searching online for coding tutorials

**Common problems and solutions:**

**Can't save your file:**
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check if you have permission to edit this project
- Try refreshing the page

**Code isn't working:**
- Check for typos in your code
- Make sure you saved your file
- Look at error messages in the terminal
- Ask someone more experienced for help

**Preview not showing changes:**
- Save your file first (Ctrl+S)
- Refresh the preview window
- Check if there are any error messages

## Best Practices

### 13. Staying Organized

**Good file naming:**
- Use descriptive names: `contact-form.html` instead of `file1.html`
- No spaces: use dashes or underscores instead
- Use lowercase letters
- Include the file type extension

**Project organization:**
- Keep related files in folders
- Create folders like: `images`, `styles`, `scripts`
- Delete files you don't need anymore

### 14. Writing Good Code

**Make it readable:**
- Use proper indentation (spaces or tabs to line things up)
- Add comments to explain what your code does
- Use meaningful variable names

**Example of good vs. bad code:**

**Bad:**
```javascript
var x = 5;
var y = 10;
var z = x + y;
```

**Good:**
```javascript
// Calculate the total price including tax
var price = 5;
var tax = 10;
var totalPrice = price + tax;
```

### 15. Saving Your Work

**Regular saving:**
- Save your work frequently (every few minutes)
- Use Ctrl+S or Cmd+S
- Look for the save icon if you're unsure

**Backing up important work:**
- Ask your admin about backup procedures
- Keep copies of really important files
- Don't rely on just one version of your project

## Security and Safety

### 16. Keeping Your Account Secure

**Password safety:**
- Don't share your password with anyone
- Use a different password than your other accounts
- Log out when you're done working

**Safe coding practices:**
- Don't download or run code you don't understand
- Ask before installing new software or libraries
- Be careful with any code that accesses files or the internet

### 17. Following the Rules

**Approval system:**
- Understand that approvals keep everyone safe
- Be patient with the approval process
- Ask for clarification if you don't understand why something was denied

**Being a good team member:**
- Don't try to bypass security measures
- Help other users who are learning
- Report any problems to your administrator
