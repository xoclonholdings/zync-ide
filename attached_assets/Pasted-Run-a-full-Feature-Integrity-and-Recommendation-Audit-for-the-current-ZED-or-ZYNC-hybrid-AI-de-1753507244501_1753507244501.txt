🎯 GOALS:
1. Diagnose what features currently exist
2. Identify missing, broken, or underutilized features
3. Recommend enhancements to improve UX, system robustness, or expand capabilities

🧠 At the end, generate:
• A summary of current features ✅  
• Missing or broken features ❌  
• Critical system gaps ⚠️  
• Recommended upgrades 🔧

Return all findings as a Markdown report with headers so we can cleanly copy into internal system docs or export to PDF if needed.
