# Zync Admin Approval System - Live Demonstration

## Overview
This demonstration shows how Zync's admin approval system completely prevents autonomous operations and requires admin authorization for all critical features.

## Test Results

### 1. Initial Blocked Operations
When users attempt actions without approval:

**Project Creation Request:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Admin approval required",
  "message": "Your request for create_project is pending admin approval",
  "requestId": "req_1753064635047_k2b6u3uc1",
  "status": "pending_approval"
}
```

**Code Execution Request:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Admin approval required", 
  "message": "Your request for execute_code is pending admin approval",
  "requestId": "req_1753064636386_kd9n22arv",
  "status": "pending_approval"
}
```

### 2. Admin Review Dashboard
Admins can see all pending requests:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "requests": [
    {
      "id": "req_1753064635047_k2b6u3uc1",
      "userId": 1,
      "requestType": "project_creation",
      "description": "User requesting access to: create_project",
      "requestData": {
        "action": "create_project",
        "data": {
          "name": "Test Project",
          "description": "Testing approval workflow"
        }
      },
      "status": "pending",
      "requestedAt": "2025-07-21T02:23:55.047Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "req_1753064636386_kd9n22arv",
      "userId": 1,
      "requestType": "code_execution",
      "description": "User requesting access to: execute_code",
      "requestData": {
        "action": "execute_code",
        "data": {
          "language": "javascript",
          "code": "console.log(\"Hello World\");",
          "projectPath": "/tmp"
        }
      },
      "status": "pending",
      "requestedAt": "2025-07-21T02:23:56.386Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Admin Decision Making

**Approval:**
```json
{"success": true, "message": "Request approved successfully"}
```

**Rejection:**
```json
{"success": true, "message": "Request rejected successfully"}
```

### 4. System Statistics
After admin decisions:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "stats": {
    "total": 3,
    "pending": 1,
    "approved": 1,
    "rejected": 1,
    "byType": {
      "code_execution": 2,
      "project_creation": 1
    },
    "approvalRate": "33.3"
  }
}
```

### 5. Emergency Override Capability

**Emergency Override Activation:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Emergency approval override activated",
  "expiresIn": "1 hour"
}
```

**During Override - Operations Allow:**
- Code execution: ✅ ALLOWED
- Terminal access: ✅ ALLOWED  
- File operations: ✅ ALLOWED
- Integration access: ✅ ALLOWED

**Override Disabled:**
```json
{"success": true, "message": "Emergency override disabled"}
```

**After Override - Operations Blocked:**
- All operations return to requiring approval: ❌ BLOCKED
